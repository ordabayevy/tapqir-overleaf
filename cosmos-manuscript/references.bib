	abstract = {Inspired by recent developments in localization microscopy that applied averaging of identical particles in 2D for increasing the resolution even further, we discuss considerations for alignment (registration) methods for particles in general and for 3D in particular. We detail that traditional techniques for particle registration from cryo electron microscopy based on cross-correlation are not suitable, as the underlying image formation process is fundamentally different. We argue that only localizations, i.e. a set of coordinates with associated uncertainties, are recorded and not a continuous intensity distribution. We present a method that owes to this fact and that is inspired by the field of statistical pattern recognition. In particular we suggest to use an adapted version of the Bhattacharyya distance as a merit function for registration. We evaluate the method in simulations and demonstrate it on 3D super-resolution data of Alexa 647 labelled to the Nup133 protein in the nuclear pore complex of Hela cells. From the simulations we find suggestions that for successful registration the localization uncertainty must be smaller than the distance between labeling sites on a particle. These suggestions are supported by theoretical considerations concerning the attainable resolution in localization microscopy and its scaling behavior as a function of labeling density and localization precision.},

Currently there is no integral, practical resolution measure that accounts for all factors. We introduce a measure based on Fourier ring correlation (FRC) that can be computed directly from an image. We demonstrate its validity and benefits on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D localization microscopy images of tubulin and actin filaments. Our FRC resolution method makes it possible to compare achieved resolutions in images taken with different nanoscopy methods, to optimize and rank different emitter localization and labeling strategies, to define a stopping criterion for data acquisition, to describe image anisotropy and heterogeneity, and even to estimate the average number of localizations per emitter. Our findings challenge the current focus on obtaining the best localization precision, showing instead how the best image resolution can be achieved as fast as possible.},

Despite being one of the best-studied model systems for transcriptional regulation, the number and conformations of loop structures accessible to LacI remain unclear, though the importance of multiple coexisting loops has been implicated in interactions between LacI and other cellular regulators of gene expression. To probe this issue, we have developed a new analysis method for tethered particle motion, a versatile and commonly used in vitro single-molecule technique. Our method, vbTPM, performs variational Bayesian inference in hidden Markov models. It learns the number of distinct states (i.e. DNA-protein conformations) directly from tethered particle motion data with better resolution than existing methods, while easily correcting for common experimental artifacts. Studying short (roughly 100 bp) LacI-mediated loops, we provide evidence for three distinct loop structures, more than previously reported in single-molecule studies. Moreover, our results confirm that changes in LacI conformation and DNA-binding topology both contribute to the repertoire of LacI-mediated loops formed in vitro, and provide qualitatively new input for models of looping and transcriptional regulation. We expect vbTPM to be broadly useful for probing complex protein-nucleic acid interactions.},

Single-molecule experiments allow us to probe both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties as well as make quantitative connections with ensemble experiments and equilibrium thermodynamics. However, it is important to be careful about the analysis of single-molecule data because of the noise present and the lack of theoretical framework for processes far away from equilibrium. Biomolecular motion whether it is free in solution, on a substrate or under force involves thermal fluctuations in varying degrees which makes the motion noisy. In addition, the noise from the experimental setup makes it even more complex. The details of biologically relevant interactions, conformational dynamics, and activities are hidden in the noisy single-molecule data. Extracting biological insights from noisy data is still an active area of research. In this review, we will focus on analyzing both fluorescence-based and forced-based single-molecule experiments and gaining biological insights. Inherently nonequilibrium nature of biological processes will be highlighted. Simulated trajectories of biomolecular diffusion will be used to compare and validate various analysis techniques.},

Because they collectively comprise one of only a few methods that can sensitively detect the ‘encounter’ complexes and subsequent intermediate states that regulate the selectivity of ligand binding, single-molecule fluorescence, and particularly single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), approaches have revolutionized studies of ligand-binding reactions. Here, we describe a widely used smFRET strategy that enables investigations of a large variety of ligand-binding reactions, and discuss two such reactions, aminoacyl-tRNA selection during translation elongation and splice site selection during spliceosome assembly, that highlight both the successes and challenges of smFRET studies of ligand-binding reactions. We conclude by reviewing a number of emerging experimental and computational approaches that are expanding the capabilities of smFRET approaches for studies of ligand-binding reactions and that promise to reveal the mechanisms that control the selectivity of ligand binding with unprecedented resolution.},

	volume = {133},
	issn = {1089-7690},
	doi = {10.1063/1.3496438},
	abstract = {The dynamics of many biological processes of interest, such as the folding of a protein, are slow and complicated enough that a single molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of the entire process is difficult to obtain in any reasonable amount of time. Moreover, one such simulation may not be sufficient to develop an understanding of the mechanism of the process, and multiple simulations may be necessary. One approach to circumvent this computational barrier is the use of Markov state models. These models are useful because they can be constructed using data from a large number of shorter simulations instead of a single long simulation. This paper presents a new Bayesian method for the construction of Markov models from simulation data. A Markov model is specified by (τ,P,T), where τ is the mesoscopic time step, P is a partition of configuration space into mesostates, and T is an N(P)×N(P) transition rate matrix for transitions between the mesostates in one mesoscopic time step, where N(P) is the number of mesostates in P. The method presented here is different from previous Bayesian methods in several ways. (1) The method uses Bayesian analysis to determine the partition as well as the transition probabilities. (2) The method allows the construction of a Markov model for any chosen mesoscopic time-scale τ. (3) It constructs Markov models for which the diagonal elements of T are all equal to or greater than 0.5. Such a model will be called a "consistent mesoscopic Markov model" (CMMM). Such models have important advantages for providing an understanding of the dynamics on a mesoscopic time-scale. The Bayesian method uses simulation data to find a posterior probability distribution for (P,T) for any chosen τ. This distribution can be regarded as the Bayesian probability that the kinetics observed in the atomistic simulation data on the mesoscopic time-scale τ was generated by the CMMM specified by (P,T). An optimization algorithm is used to find the most probable CMMM for the chosen mesoscopic time step. We applied this method of Markov model construction to several toy systems (random walks in one and two dimensions) as well as the dynamics of alanine dipeptide in water. The resulting Markov state models were indeed successful in capturing the dynamics of our test systems on a variety of mesoscopic time-scales.},

Time stamp (TS) measurement has been employed experimentally to enrich information within the signals, while data analyses such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) have been successfully applied to recover the trajectories of molecular state transitions from time-binned photon counting signals or images. In this article, we introduce the HMM for TS-FRET signals, employing the variational Bayes (VB) inference to solve the model, and demonstrate the application of VB-HMM-TS-FRET to simulated TS-FRET data. The same analysis using VB-HMM is conducted for other models and the previously reported change point detection scheme. The performance is compared to other analysis methods or data types and we show that our VB-HMM-TS-FRET analysis can achieve the best performance and results in the highest time resolution. Finally, an smFRET experiment was conducted to observe spontaneous branch migration of Holliday-junction DNA. VB-HMM-TS-FRET was successfully applied to reconstruct the state transition trajectory with the number of states consistent with the nucleotide sequence. The results suggest that a single migration process frequently involves rearrangement of multiple basepairs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent explosion of experimental techniques in single molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time series data requiring equally novel computational tools for analysis and inference. This article describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from biophysical time series data using the variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by the example of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) versus time data, where the smFRET time series is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as well.
RESULTS: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence and an approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. The former provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence (ME), and the latter a description of the model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood (ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the most important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed (non-divergent) optimization problem.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single molecule biophysics.},

	abstract = {Summary
RecA and its homologs help maintain genomic integrity through recombination. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays and hidden Markov modeling, we show the most direct evidence that a RecA filament grows and shrinks primarily one monomer at a time and only at the extremities. Both ends grow and shrink, contrary to expectation, but a higher binding rate at one end is responsible for directional filament growth. Quantitative rate determination also provides insights into how RecA might control DNA accessibility in vivo. We find that about five monomers are sufficient for filament nucleation. Although ordinarily single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) prevents filament nucleation, single RecA monomers can easily be added to an existing filament and displace SSB from DNA at the rate of filament extension. This supports the proposal for a passive role of RecA-loading machineries in SSB removal.},

The factors that limit the precision of these techniques are examined and a simple equation derived that describes the precision of localization over a wide range of conditions. In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares fitting theory is constructed and tested both on image stacks of 30-nm fluorescent beads and on computer-generated images (Monte Carlo simulations). Results from the algorithm show good agreement with the derived precision equation for both the simulations and actual images. The availability of a simple equation to describe localization precision helps investigators both in assessing the quality of an experimental apparatus and in directing attention to the factors that limit further improvement. The precision of localization scales as the inverse square root of the number of photons in the spot for the shot noise limited case and as the inverse of the number of photons for the background noise limited case. The optimal image magnification depends on the expected number of photons and background noise, but, for most cases of interest, the pixel size should be about equal to the standard deviation of the point spread function.},

A plethora of computer algorithms have been developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have "nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference, centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects ranging in size from point sources to 5 [mu]m were computer generated with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision. We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise. Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise ratio approaches 4. We judge direct Gaussian fit to be the best algorithm when tracking single fluorophores, where the signal-to-noise is frequently near 4.},

Molecular recognition and high precision (30 nm) simultaneous automatic tracking of all of the individual receptors in the cell surface population utilize quantitative time-lapse low light level digital video fluorescence microscopy analyzed by purpose-designed algorithms executed on an image processing work station. The LDL-Rs are labeled with the biologically active, fluorescent LDL derivative dil-LDL. Individual LDL-Rs and unresolved small clusters are identified by measuring the fluorescence power radiated by the sub-resolution fluorescent spots in the image; identification of single particles is ascertained by four independent techniques. An automated tracking routine was developed to track simultaneously, and without user intervention, a multitude of fluorescent particles through a sequence of hundreds of time-lapse image frames. The limitations on tracking precision were found to depend on the signal-to-noise ratio of the tracked particle image and mechanical drift of the microscope system. We describe the methods involved in (i) time-lapse acquisition of the low-light level images, (ii) simultaneous automated tracking of the fluorescent diffraction limited punctate images, (iii) localizing particles with high precision and limitations, and (iv) detecting and identifying single and clustered LDL-Rs. These methods are generally applicable and provide a powerful tool to visualize and measure dynamics and interactions of individual integral membrane proteins on living cell surfaces.},

However, all experimental strategies realized so far confined the observation to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished. We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules can be visualized and tracked in three-dimensional (3D) samples at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with an Ar+-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera, single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to {\textasciitilde}10 [mu]m from the interface. A time resolution of 5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The two-dimensional localization accuracy was determined to be {\textasciitilde}30 nm. The number of photons emitted by single GFP molecules before photodestruction was found to be {\textless}= 4105. Freely diffusing GFP molecules could be tracked over up to nine images acquired at a frame rate of {\textasciitilde}80 Hz. From the trajectories, the diffusion coefficients of single GFP molecules were derived and found to agree well with expectation and microphotolysis measurements. Our results imply that the visualization and tracking of single molecules in living cells is possible.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) can be applied to extract single channel kinetics at signal-to-noise ratios that are too low for conventional analysis. There are two general HMM approaches: traditional Baum's reestimation and direct optimization. The optimization approach has the advantage that it optimizes the rate constants directly. This allows setting constraints on the rate constants, fitting multiple data sets across different experimental conditions, and handling nonstationary channels where the starting probability of the channel depends on the unknown kinetics. We present here an extension of this approach that addresses the additional issues of low-pass filtering and correlated noise. The filtering is modeled using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter applied to the underlying signal, and the noise correlation is accounted for using an autoregressive (AR) process. In addition to correlated background noise, the algorithm allows for excess open channel noise that can be white or correlated. To maximize the efficiency of the algorithm, we derive the analytical derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to all unknown model parameters. The search of the likelihood space is performed using a variable metric method. Extension of the algorithm to data containing multiple channels is described. Examples are presented that demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the algorithm. Practical issues such as the selection of appropriate noise AR orders are also discussed through examples.},

The method utilizes the joint probability density of the observed dwell time sequence as likelihood. A forward-backward recursive procedure is developed for efficient computation of the likelihood function and its derivatives with respect to the model parameters. Based on the calculated forward and backward vectors, analytical formulae for the derivatives of the likelihood function are derived. The method exploits the variable metric optimizer for search of the likelihood space. It converges rapidly and is numerically stable. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the method.},

	abstract = {Many processes in biology and chemistry involve multistep reactions or transitions. The kinetic data associated with these reactions are manifested by superpositions of exponential decays that are often difficult to dissect. Two major challenges have hampered the kinetic analysis of multistep chemical reactions:  (1) reliable and unbiased determination of the number of reaction steps, and (2) stable reconstruction of the distribution of kinetic rate constants. Here, we introduce two numerically stable integral transformations to solve these two challenges. The first transformation enables us to deduce the number of rate-limiting steps from kinetic measurements, even when each step has arbitrarily distributed rate constants. The second transformation allows us to reconstruct the distribution of rate constants in the multistep reaction using the phase function approach, without fitting the data. We demonstrate the stability of the two integral transformations by both analytic proofs and numerical tests. These new methods will help provide robust and unbiased kinetic analysis for many complex chemical and biochemical reactions.},

The analysis is essentially the same: one investigates the changes in the degrees of freedom followed. For instance, in a single molecule fluorescence experiment, the degree of freedom is often the number of photons detected in some time period. In this article, we introduce a straightforward Bayesian method for detecting if and when changes occurred. In contrast to methods based upon maximum likelihood estimates, a Bayesian approach allows for a more systematic means not only to change point detection but also to cluster the data into states. Most importantly, the Bayesian method supplies a simpler hypothesis testing framework. Although we focus on Poisson-distributed data, the Bayesian methods outlined here can in principle be applied to data sampled from any distribution.},

Such systems often have a large number of possible assembly/disassembly intermediates and complex, highly branched reaction pathways. Measuring the single-step kinetic parameters in these reactions would help to identify the functionally significant pathways. We have therefore constructed a novel single-molecule fluorescence microscope capable of efficiently detecting the colocalization of multiple components in a macromolecular complex when each component is labeled using a different color fluorescent dye. In this through-objective excitation, total internal reflection instrument, the dichroic mirror conventionally used to spectrally segregate the excitation and emission pathways was replaced with small broadband mirrors. This design spatially segregates the excitation and emission pathways and thereby permits efficient collection of the spectral range of emitted fluorescence when three or more dyes are used. In a test experiment with surface-immobilized single-stranded DNA molecules, we directly monitored the time course of a hybridization reaction with three different oligonucleotides, each labeled with a different color dye. The experiment reveals which of the possible reaction intermediates were traversed by each immobilized molecule, measures the hybridization rate constants for each oligonucleotide, and characterizes kinetic interdependences of the reaction steps.},

We describe a simple and robust method to estimate the rates of transitions between different conformational states and the FRET efficiencies associated with these states. For a photon trajectory with measured interphoton times, the pattern of colors is decoded by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. This approach can be used to analyze bursts of photons from diffusing molecules as well as photon trajectories generated by immobilized molecules. The procedure is illustrated using simulated photon trajectories corresponding to two-state and three-state molecules. The method works even when the photon colors appear to be scrambled because of high background noise, the photophysical properties of the conformers are similar, or the conformational and photon count rates are comparable. The consistency of the model with the data can be checked by recoloring the photon trajectories and comparing the predicted and observed FRET efficiency histograms.},

However, in UHMM, only the calculated FRET trajectory is analyzed. On the basis of the analysis of both synthetic and experimental data, we find that, if the noise in the signal is described with a proper probability distribution, MHMM generally outperforms UHMM.

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMM) have been proposed as a method of analysis for noisy single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SM FRET) data. However, there are practical and fundamental limits in applying HMM to SM FRET data due to the short photobleaching lifetimes of fluorophores and the limited time resolution of detection devices. The fast photobleaching fluorophores yield short SM FRET time traces, and the limited detection time resolution generates abnormal FRET values, which result in systematic underestimation of kinetic rates. In this work, a HMM algorithm is implemented to optimize one set of HMM parameters with multiple short SM FRET traces. The FRET efficiency distribution function for the HMM optimization was modified to accommodate the abnormal FRET values resulting from limited detection time resolution. Computer simulations reveal that one set of HMM parameters is optimized successfully using multiple short SM FRET traces and that the degree of the kinetic rate underestimation is reduced by using the proposed modified FRET efficiency distribution. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that HMM can be used to reproducibly analyze short SM FRET time traces.},

	abstract = {The Mediator kinase module regulates eukaryotic transcription by phosphorylating transcription-related targets and by modulating the association of Mediator and RNA polymerase II. The activity of its catalytic core, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), is controlled by Cyclin C and regulatory subunit MED12, with its deregulation contributing to numerous malignancies. Here, we combine in vitro biochemistry, cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry, and in vivo studies to describe the binding location of the N-terminal segment of MED12 on the CDK8/Cyclin C complex and to gain mechanistic insights into the activation of CDK8 by MED12. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal portion of MED12 wraps around CDK8, whereby it positions an “activation helix” close to the T-loop of CDK8 for its activation. Intriguingly, mutations in the activation helix that are frequently found in cancers do not diminish the affinity of MED12 for CDK8, yet likely alter the exact positioning of the activation helix. Furthermore, we find the transcriptome-wide gene-expression changes in human cells that result from a mutation in the MED12 activation helix to correlate with deregulated genes in breast and colon cancer. Finally, functional assays in the presence of kinase inhibitors reveal that binding of MED12 remodels the active site of CDK8 and thereby precludes the inhibition of ternary CDK8 complexes by type II kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our results not only allow us to propose a revised model of how CDK8 activity is regulated by MED12, but also offer a path forward in developing small molecules that target CDK8 in its MED12-bound form.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of single-molecule identification in super-resolution microscopy. Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by localizing individual fluorescing molecules in a field of view. This is particularly difficult since each individual molecule appears and disappears randomly across time and because the total number of molecules in the field of view is unknown. Additionally, data sets acquired with super-resolution microscopes can contain a large number of spurious fluorescent fluctuations caused by background noise.
          To address these problems, we present a Bayesian nonparametric framework capable of identifying individual emitting molecules in super-resolved time series. We tackle the localization problem in the case in which each individual molecule is already localized in space. First, we collapse observations in time and develop a fast algorithm that builds upon the Dirichlet process. Next, we augment the model to account for the temporal aspect of fluorophore photo-physics. Finally, we assess the performance of our methods with ground-truth data sets having known biological structure.},

	abstract = {A dual-view imaging system for simultaneous four-color single-molecule (SM) detection was developed. As for the detection procedure, four species of SM fluorophores, namely, Alexa 488, 555, 647, and 680, are immobilized on different slides and excited by evanescent-wave illumination. Fluorescence emitted from an SM fluorophore is split by a wide-range dichroic mirror (WR DM) in a dual-view optics and imaged as two SM fluorescence spots (SM spots) on an EM (electron-multiplying)-CCD at 100 Hz. The transmittance of the WR DM changes gradually over the wavelength range of 500 to 700 nm so that the signal ratios of the two SM spots for the four fluorophore species differ. A method for classifying SM fluorophores into four species in accordance with their signal ratios was developed. It was used to classify 597 SM fluorophores at accuracy of above 98\% for all the species. This accuracy is comparable to that of a conventional four-color SM detection system. To classify four species, the conventional system disperses SM fluorescence with a prism and provides an elongated SM spot that uses more pixels of an EM-CCD chip than that of the developed system. The developed system can thus detect 1.5-fold more SM spots with the same-size EM-CCD chip, so it can achieve 1.5-fold higher throughput. Moreover, the developed system is based on a simple and practical approach, namely, replacing an ordinary dichroic mirror in a commercially available dual-view optics with a WR DM. This replacement transforms a dual-view imaging system for two-color detection into a system for four-color detection. The developed system is suitable for detection systems of next-generation DNA sequencers and DNA microarray-chip analyzers.},

	abstract = {The resolution of super-resolution microscopy based on single molecule localization is in part determined by the accuracy of the localization algorithm. In most published approaches to date this localization is done by fitting an analytical function that approximates the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope. However, particularly for localization in 3D, analytical functions such as a Gaussian, which are computationally inexpensive, may not accurately capture the PSF shape leading to reduced fitting accuracy. On the other hand, analytical functions that can accurately capture the PSF shape, such as those based on pupil functions, can be computationally expensive. Here we investigate the use of cubic splines as an alternative fitting approach. We demonstrate that cubic splines can capture the shape of any PSF with high accuracy and that they can be used for fitting the PSF with only a 2–3x increase in computation time as compared to Gaussian fitting. We provide an open-source software package that measures the PSF of any microscope and uses the measured PSF to perform 3D single molecule localization microscopy analysis with reasonable accuracy and speed.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule kinetic experiments allow the reaction trajectories of individual biomolecules to be directly observed, eliminating the effects of population averaging and providing a powerful approach for elucidating the kinetic mechanisms of biomolecular processes. A major challenge to the analysis and interpretation of these experiments, however, is the kinetic heterogeneity that almost universally complicates the recorded single-molecule signal versus time trajectories (i.e., signal trajectories). Such heterogeneity manifests as changes and/or differences in the transition rates that are observed within individual signal trajectories or across a population of signal trajectories. Although characterizing kinetic heterogeneity can provide critical mechanistic information, there are currently no computational methods available that effectively and/or comprehensively enable such analysis. To address this gap, we have developed a computational algorithm and software program, hFRET, that uses the variational approximation for Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical hidden Markov model, thereby enabling robust identification and characterization of kinetic heterogeneity. Using simulated signal trajectories, we demonstrate the ability of hFRET to accurately and precisely characterize kinetic heterogeneity. In addition, we use hFRET to analyze experimentally recorded signal trajectories reporting on the conformational dynamics of ribosomal pre-translocation (PRE) complexes. The results of our analyses demonstrate that PRE complexes exhibit kinetic heterogeneity, reveal the physical origins of this heterogeneity, and allow us to expand the current model of PRE complex dynamics. The methods described here can be applied to signal trajectories generated using any type of signal and can be easily extended to the analysis of signal trajectories exhibiting more complex kinetic behaviors. Moreover, variations of our approach can be easily developed to integrate kinetic data obtained from different experimental constructs and/or from molecular dynamics simulations of a biomolecule of interest. The hFRET source code, graphical user interface, and user manual can be downloaded as freeware at https://github.com/GonzalezBiophysicsLab/hFRET.},

For single molecule studies, tools for automated analysis that are crucial for rapid progress, need to be effective under large noise magnitudes, and often must assume little or no prior knowledge of parameters being studied. This article examines an iterated, dynamic programming based step detection algorithm (SDA). It is established that given a prior estimate, an iteration of the SDA necessarily improves the estimate. The analysis provides an explanation and a conﬁrmation of the effectiveness of the learning and estimation capabilities of the algorithm observed empirically. Further, an alternative application of the SDA is demonstrated, wherein the parameters of a worm-like chain (WLC) model are estimated, for the automated analysis of data from single molecule protein pulling experiments.},

In many experiments in which molecules are tagged with a single or small number of fluorophores, the signal/noise ratio may be limiting, the number of molecules is not known, and fluorophore blinking and photobleaching can occur. All these factors make accurate tracking over long trajectories difficult and hence there is still a pressing need to develop better algorithms to extract the maximum information from a sequence of fluorescence images. We describe here a Bayesian-based inference approach, based on a trans-dimensional sequential Monte Carlo method that utilizes both the spatial and temporal information present in the image sequences. We show, using model data, where the real trajectory of the molecule is known, that our method allows accurate tracking of molecules over long trajectories even with low signal/noise ratio and in the presence of fluorescence blinking and photobleaching. The method is then applied to real experimental data.},

The origin-recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 facilitate this process by establishing a topological link between each Mcm2–7 hexamer and origin DNA. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we monitored ring opening and closing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm2–7 during origin licensing. The two Mcm2–7 rings were open during initial DNA association and closed sequentially, concomitant with the release of their associated Cdt1. We observed that ATP hydrolysis by Mcm2–7 was coupled to ring closure and Cdt1 release, and failure to load the first Mcm2–7 prevented recruitment of the second Mcm2–7. Our findings identify key mechanisms controlling the Mcm2–7 DNA-entry gate during origin licensing, and reveal that the two Mcm2–7 complexes are loaded via a coordinated series of events with implications for bidirectional replication initiation and quality control.},

Proteins of different species, individually labelled with a single fluorophore, can be imaged as isolated spots (features) of different colour light in different channels, and their diffusive behaviour in cells directly measured through time. Challenges in data analysis have, however, thus far hindered its application in biology. A set of methods for the automated analysis of multidimensional single molecule microscopy data from cells is presented, incorporating Bayesian segmentation-based feature detection, image registration and particle tracking. Single molecules of different colours can be simultaneously detected in noisy, high background data with an arbitrary number of channels, acquired simultaneously or time-multiplexed, and then tracked through time. The resulting traces can be further analysed, for example to detect intensity steps, count discrete intensity levels, measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or changes in polarisation. Examples are shown illustrating the use of the algorithms in investigations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling network, a key target for cancer therapeutics, and with simulated data.},

The probability value has consequences for downstream data analysis, such as weighing a series of detections and corresponding probabilities, Bayesian propagation of probability, or defining metrics in tracking applications. We show that the method outperforms all current approaches, yielding a detection efficiency of {\textgreater}70\% and a false-positive detection rate of {\textless}5\% under conditions down to 17 photons/pixel background and 180 photons/molecule signal, which is beneficial for any kind of photon-limited application.

	abstract = {Joining of the large, 50S, ribosomal subunit to the small, 30S, ribosomal subunit initiation complex (IC) during bacterial translation initiation is catalyzed by the initiation factor (IF) IF2. Because the rate of subunit joining is coupled to the IF, transfer RNA (tRNA), and mRNA codon compositions of the 30S IC, the subunit joining reaction functions as a kinetic checkpoint that regulates the fidelity of translation initiation. Recent structural studies suggest that the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex forming on the intersubunit surface of the 30S IC may play a significant role in the mechanisms that couple the rate of subunit joining to the IF, tRNA, and codon compositions of the 30S IC. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal between IF2 and tRNA that has enabled us to monitor the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex across a series of 30S ICs. Our results demonstrate that 30S ICs undergoing rapid subunit joining display a high affinity for IF2 and an IF2·tRNA sub-complex that primarily samples a single conformation. In contrast, 30S ICs that undergo slower subunit joining exhibit a decreased affinity for IF2 and/or a change in the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex. These results strongly suggest that 30S IC-driven changes in the stability of IF2 and the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex regulate the efficiency and fidelity of subunit joining during translation initiation.},

However, while static, ensemble techniques yield thermodynamic data, often only dynamic, single-molecule techniques can yield the kinetic data that describe transition-state energy barriers. Here we present a generalized framework based upon dwell-time distributions that can be used to connect such static, ensemble techniques with dynamic, single-molecule techniques, and thus characterize energy landscapes to greater resolutions. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by applying it to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies of the bacterial ribosomal pre-translocation complex. Among other benefits, application of this framework to these data explains why two transient, intermediate conformations of the pre-translocation complex, which are observed in a cryo-EM study, may not be observed in several smFRET studies.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) has revolutionized kinetic studies of macromolecules. However, results from HMM often violate detailed balance when applied to the transitions under thermodynamic equilibrium, and the consequence of such violation has not been well understood. Here, to our knowledge, we developed a new HMM method that satisfies detailed balance (HMM-DB) and optimizes model parameters by gradient search. We used free energy of stable and transition states as independent fitting parameters and considered both normal and skew normal distributions of the measurement noise. We validated our method by analyzing simulated extension trajectories that mimicked experimental data of single protein folding from optical tweezers. We then applied HMM-DB to elucidate kinetics of regulated SNARE zippering containing degenerate states. For both simulated and measured trajectories, we found that HMM-DB significantly reduced overfitting of short trajectories compared to the standard HMM based on an expectation-maximization algorithm, leading to more accurate and reliable model fitting by HMM-DB. We revealed how HMM-DB could be conveniently used to derive a simplified energy landscape of protein folding. Finally, we extended HMM-DB to correct the baseline drift in single-molecule trajectories. Together, we demonstrated an efficient, versatile, and reliable method of HMM for kinetics studies of macromolecules under thermodynamic equilibrium.},

This analysis technique reveals an unprecedented amount of detail in the folding kinetics of the Diels–Alderase ribozyme. We find a multitude of extended (low-FRET) and compact (high-FRET) states. Five states were consistently and independently identified in two FRET constructs and at three Mg2+ concentrations. Structures generally tend to become more compact upon addition of Mg2+. Some compact structures are observed to significantly depend on Mg2+ concentration, suggesting a tertiary fold stabilized by Mg2+ ions. One compact structure was observed to be Mg2+-independent, consistent with stabilization by tertiary Watson–Crick base pairing found in the folded Diels–Alderase structure. A hierarchy of time scales was discovered, including dynamics of 10 ms or faster, likely due to tertiary structure fluctuations, and slow dynamics on the seconds time scale, presumably associated with significant changes in secondary structure. The folding pathways proceed through a series of intermediate secondary structures. There exist both compact pathways and more complex ones, which display tertiary unfolding, then secondary refolding, and, subsequently, again tertiary refolding.},

By photoswitching, multiple donor–acceptor fluorophore pairs can be probed sequentially, thus allowing observation of multiple distances within a single immobilized molecule. Control of the photoinduced switching rates permits adjustment of the temporal resolution of switchable FRET over a wide range of timescales, thereby facilitating application to various dynamical biological systems. We show that fast total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy can achieve measurements of two FRET pairs with 10 ms temporal resolution within less than 2 s. The concept of switchable FRET is also compatible with confocal microscopy on immobilized molecules, providing better data quality at high temporal resolution. To identify states and extract their transitions from switchable FRET time traces, we also develop linked hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of both FRET and donor–acceptor stoichiometry. Linked HMM successfully identifies transient states in the two-dimensional FRET–stoichiometry space and reconstructs their connectivity network. Improved temporal resolution and novel data analysis make switchable FRET a valuable tool in molecular and structural biology.},

We generalize the model introduced by Green and Mardia for the pairwise alignment of two unlabeled configurations to full similarity transformations by introducing a scaling factor to the model. The generalization is not straight-forward, since the model needs to be reformulated to give good performance when scaling is included. We illustrate our method on the alignment of rat growth profiles and a novel application to the alignment of protein domains. Here, scaling is applied to secondary structure elements when comparing protein folds; additionally, we find that one global scaling factor is not in general sufficient to model these data and, hence, we develop a model in which multiple scale factors can be included to handle different scalings of shape components.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	abstract = {Time-resolved single molecule fluorescence measurements may be used to probe the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules. The best time resolution in such techniques will only be achieved by measuring the arrival times of individual photons at the detector. A general approach to the estimation of molecular parameters based on individual photon arrival times is presented. The amount of information present in a data set is quantified by the Fisher information, thereby providing a guide to deriving the basic equations relating measurement uncertainties and time resolution. Based on these information-theoretical considerations, a data analysis algorithm is presented that details the optimal analysis of single-molecule data. This method natively accounts and corrects for background photons and cross talk, and can scale to an arbitrary number of channels. By construction, and with corroboration from computer simulations, we show that this algorithm reaches the theoretical limit, extracting the maximal information out of the data. The bias inherent in the algorithm is considered and its implications for experimental design are discussed. The ideas underlying this approach are general and are expected to be applicable to any information-limited measurement.},

The purpose of this paper is to compare the EM and MCMC approaches in three cases of different complexity; the examples include model order selection, continuous-time HMMs and variants of HMMs in which the observed data depends on many hidden variables in an overlapping fashion. All these examples in some way or another originate from real-data applications. Neither EM nor MCMC analysis of HMMs is a black-box methodology without need for user-interaction, and we will illustrate some of the problems, like poor mixing and long computation times, one may expect to encounter.},

	abstract = {A key problem in statistics and machine learning is inferring suitable structure of a model given some observed data. A Bayesian approach to model comparison makes use of the marginal likelihood of each candidate model to form a posterior distribution over models; unfortunately for most models of interest, notably those containing hidden or latent variables, the marginal likelihood is intractable to compute. We present the variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm for directed graphical models, which optimises a lower bound approximation to the marginal likelihood in a procedure similar to the standard EM algorithm. We show that for a large class of models, which we call conjugate exponential, the VB algorithm is a straightforward generalisation of the EM algorithm that incorporates uncertainty over model parameters. In a thorough case study using a small class of bipartite DAGs containing hidden variables, we compare the accuracy of the VB approximation to existing asymptotic-data approximations such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Cheeseman-Stutz (CS) criterion, and also to a sampling based gold standard, Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). We find that the VB algorithm is empirically superior to CS and BIC, and much faster than AIS. Moreover, we prove that a VB approximation can always be constructed in such a way that guarantees it to be more accurate than the CS approximation.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence imaging and counting of single molecules adsorbed or bound to surfaces are being employed in a number of quantitative analysis applications. Reliable molecular counts with knowledge of counting uncertainties, both false-positive and false-negative probabilities, are critical to these applications. By counting stationary single molecules on a surface, spatial criteria may be applied to the image analysis to improve confidence in detection, which is especially critical when detecting single fluorescent labels. In this work, we describe a simple approach to incorporating spatial criteria for counting single molecules by using an intensity threshold to locate regions with multiple, adjacent intense pixels, where the size of these regions is guided by the point-spread function of the microscope. By requiring multiple, spatially correlated bright pixels, false-positive events resulting from random samples of background noise are minimized. The reliability of detection is established by quantitative knowledge of the distributions of background and signals. By measuring and modeling both the background and single-molecule intensity distributions, false-positive and false-negative detection probabilities are estimated for arbitrary threshold parameters by using combinatorial statistics. From this theory, detection parameters can be optimized to minimize false-positive and false-negative probabilities, which can be calculated explicitly. For detection of single rhodamine 6G molecules at a threshold set at 2.5 times the standard deviation above background, the false-negative probability was only 1.5\%, determined from distributions of single-molecule intensities on well-populated surfaces, and the false-positive probability from background noise was 2.8 spots per 50 ? 50 ?m image. The false-positive events compare favorably with theoretical probabilities calculated using combinatorial statistical analysis and simulated false-positive events counted in images of random noise.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule methods have given researchers the ability to investigate the structural dynamics of biomolecules at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. One of the preferred methods of studying single biomolecules is single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). The popularity of smFRET stems from its ability to report on dynamic, either intra- or intermolecular interactions in real-time. For example, smFRET has been successfully used to characterize the role of dynamics in functional RNAs and their protein complexes, including ribozymes, the ribosome, and more recently the spliceosome. Being able to reliably extract quantitative kinetic and conformational parameters from smFRET experiments is crucial for the interpretation of their results. The need for efficient, unbiased analysis routines becomes more evident as the systems studied become more complex. In this chapter, we focus on the practical utility of statistical algorithms, particularly hidden Markov models, to aid in the objective quantification of complex smFRET trajectories with three or more discrete states, and to extract kinetic information from the trajectories. Additionally, we present a method for systematically eliminating transitions associated with uncorrelated fluorophore behavior that may occur due to dye anisotropy and quenching effects. We also highlight the importance of data condensation through the use of various transition density plots to fully understand the underlying conformational dynamics and kinetic behavior of the biological macromolecule of interest under varying conditions. Finally, the application of these techniques to studies of pre-mRNA conformational changes during eukaryotic splicing is discussed.},

	abstract = {Many single-molecule experiments aim to characterize biomolecular processes in terms of kinetic models that specify the rates of transition between conformational states of the biomolecule. Estimation of these rates often requires analysis of a population of molecules, in which the conformational trajectory of each molecule is represented by a noisy, time-dependent signal trajectory. Although hidden Markov models (HMMs) may be used to infer the conformational trajectories of individual molecules, estimating a consensus kinetic model from the population of inferred conformational trajectories remains a statistically difficult task, as inferred parameters vary widely within a population. Here, we demonstrate how a recently developed empirical Bayesian method for HMMs can be extended to enable a more automated and statistically principled approach to two widely occurring tasks in the analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments: 1), the characterization of changes in rates across a series of experiments performed under variable conditions; and 2), the detection of degenerate states that exhibit the same FRET efficiency but differ in their rates of transition. We apply this newly developed methodology to two studies of the bacterial ribosome, each exemplary of one of these two analysis tasks. We conclude with a discussion of model-selection techniques for determination of the appropriate number of conformational states. The code used to perform this analysis and a basic graphical user interface front end are available as open source software.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule detection in fluorescence nanoscopy has become a powerful tool in cell biology but can present vexing issues in image analysis, such as limited signal, unspecific background, empirically set thresholds, image filtering, and false-positive detection limiting overall detection efficiency. Here we present a framework in which expert knowledge and parameter tweaking are replaced with a probability-based hypothesis test. Our method delivers robust and threshold-free signal detection with a defined error estimate and improved detection of weaker signals. The probability value has consequences for downstream data analysis, such as weighing a series of detections and corresponding probabilities, Bayesian propagation of probability, or defining metrics in tracking applications. We show that the method outperforms all current approaches, yielding a detection efficiency of {\textgreater}70\% and a false-positive detection rate of {\textless}5\% under conditions down to 17 photons/pixel background and 180 photons/molecule signal, which is beneficial for any kind of photon-limited application. Examples include limited brightness and photostability, phototoxicity in live-cell single-molecule imaging, and use of new labels for nanoscopy. We present simulations, experimental data, and tracking of low-signal mRNAs in yeast cells.},

	abstract = {This book is unique in that it covers the philosophy of model-based data analysis and a strategy for the analysis of empirical data. Model selection, under the information theoretic approach presented here, attempts to identify the (likely) best model, orders the models from best to worst, and measures the plausibility ("calibration") that each model is really the best as an inference. Model selection methods are extended to allow inference from more than a single "best" model. Several methods are given that allow the uncertainty as to which model is "best" to be incorporated into estimates of precision. An array of examples are given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians using models for making inferences from empirical data. Research biologists working either in the field or in the laboratory will find simple methods that are likely to be useful in their investigations. Applied statisticians will find the information theoretic methods presented here quite useful and a superior alternative, especially for observational studies. People interested in the empirical sciences will find this material useful as it offers an alternative to hypothesis testing and Bayesian approaches.},

	abstract = {Based on a course in the theory of statistics this text concentrates on what can be achieved using the likelihood/Fisherian method of taking account of uncertainty when studying a statistical problem. It takes the concept ot the likelihood as providing the best methods for unifying the demands of statistical modelling and the theory of inference. Every likelihood concept is illustrated by realistic examples, which are not compromised by computational problems. Examples range from a simile comparison of two accident rates, to complex studies that require generalised linear or semiparametric modelling. The emphasis is that the likelihood is not simply a device to produce an estimate, but an important tool for modelling. The book generally takes an informal approach, where most important results are established using heuristic arguments and motivated with realistic examples. With the currently available computing power, examples are not contrived to allow a closed analytical solution, and the book can concentrate on the statistical aspects of the data modelling. In addition to classical likelihood theory, the book covers many modern topics such as generalized linear models and mixed models, non parametric smoothing, robustness, the EM algorithm and empirical likelihood.},

	abstract = {Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography.

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140–142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

	abstract = {Universal common ancestry (UCA) is a central pillar of modern evolutionary theory. As first suggested by Darwin, the theory of UCA posits that all extant terrestrial organisms share a common genetic heritage, each being the genealogical descendant of a single species from the distant past. The classic evidence for UCA, although massive, is largely restricted to ‘local’ common ancestry—for example, of specific phyla rather than the entirety of life—and has yet to fully integrate the recent advances from modern phylogenetics and probability theory. Although UCA is widely assumed, it has rarely been subjected to formal quantitative testing, and this has led to critical commentary emphasizing the intrinsic technical difficulties in empirically evaluating a theory of such broad scope. Furthermore, several researchers have proposed that early life was characterized by rampant horizontal gene transfer, leading some to question the monophyly of life. Here I provide the first, to my knowledge, formal, fundamental test of UCA, without assuming that sequence similarity implies genetic kinship. I test UCA by applying model selection theory to molecular phylogenies, focusing on a set of ubiquitously conserved proteins that are proposed to be orthologous. Among a wide range of biological models involving the independent ancestry of major taxonomic groups, the model selection tests are found to overwhelmingly support UCA irrespective of the presence of horizontal gene transfer and symbiotic fusion events. These results provide powerful statistical evidence corroborating the monophyly of all known life.},

Ba2+, a doubly charged analogue of K+, specifically blocks K+ channels by virtue of electrostatic stabilization in the permeation pathway. Ba2+ block is used here as a tool to determine the equilibrium binding affinity for various monovalent cations at specific sites in the selectivity filter of a noninactivating mutant of KcsA. At high concentrations of external K+, the block-time distribution is double exponential, marking at least two Ba2+ sites in the selectivity filter, in accord with a Ba2+-containing crystal structure of KcsA. By analyzing block as a function of extracellular K+, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant of K+ and of other monovalent cations at an extracellular site, presumably S1, to arrive at a selectivity sequence for binding at this site: Rb+ (3 µM) {\textgreater} Cs+ (23 µM) {\textgreater} K+ (29 µM) {\textgreater} NH4+ (440 µM) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Na+ and Li+ ({\textgreater}1 M). This represents an unusually high selectivity for K+ over Na+, with {\textbar}ΔΔG0{\textbar} of at least 7 kcal mol−1. These results fit well with other kinetic measurements of selectivity as well as with the many crystal structures of KcsA in various ionic conditions.},

While conventional superpositioning methods use ordinary least-squares (LS) as the optimization criterion, ML superpositions provide substantially improved accuracy by down-weighting variable structural regions and by correcting for correlations among atoms. ML superpositioning is robust and insensitive to the specific atoms included in the analysis, and thus it does not require subjective pruning of selected variable atomic coordinates. Output includes both likelihood-based and frequentist statistics for accurate evaluation of the adequacy of a superposition and for reliable analysis of structural similarities and differences. THESEUS performs principal components analysis for analyzing the complex correlations found among atoms within a structural ensemble.

Procrustes problems arise in a wide range of scientific disciplines, especially when the geometrical shapes of objects are compared, contrasted, and analyzed. Classically, the optimal transformations are found by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between corresponding points in the forms. Despite its widespread use, the ordinary unweighted least-squares (LS) criterion can give erroneous solutions when the errors have heterogeneous variances (heteroscedasticity) or the errors are correlated, both common occurrences with real data. In contrast, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation can provide accurate and consistent statistical estimates in the presence of both heteroscedasticity and correlation. Here we provide a complete solution to the nonisotropic ML Procrustes problem assuming a matrix Gaussian distribution with factored covariances. Our analysis generalizes, simplifies, and extends results from previous discussions of the ML Procrustes problem. An iterative algorithm is presented for the simultaneous, numerical determination of the ML solutions.},

	abstract = {Macromolecular function is rooted in energy landscapes, where sequence determines not a single structure but an ensemble of conformations. Hence, evolution modifies a protein’s function by altering its energy landscape. Here, we recreate the evolutionary pathway between two modern human oncogenes, Src and Abl, by reconstructing their common ancestors. Our evolutionary reconstruction combined with x-ray structures of the common ancestor and pre–steady-state kinetics reveals a detailed atomistic mechanism for selectivity of the successful cancer drug Gleevec. Gleevec affinity is gained during the evolutionary trajectory toward Abl and lost toward Src, primarily by shifting an induced-fit equilibrium that is also disrupted in the clinical T315I resistance mutation. This work reveals the mechanism of Gleevec specificity while offering insights into how energy landscapes evolve.
Evolution of dynamics affects function
The drug Gleevac inhibits Abl kinases and is used to treat multiple cancers. The closely related Src kinases also play a role in cancer but are not inhibited effectively by Gleevac. Nevertheless, Gleevac-bound structures of Src and Abl are nearly identical. Based on this structural information and protein sequence data, Wilson et al. reconstructed the common ancestor of Src and Abl. Mutations that affected conformational dynamics caused Gleevac affinity to be gained on the evolutionary trajectory toward Abl and lost on the trajectory toward Src.

A common challenge upon introduction of novel, data-rich approaches is the management, processing, and analysis of the complex data sets that are generated. We provide a standardized approach for analyzing these data in the freely available software package SMART: Single Molecule Analysis Research Tool. SMART provides a format for organizing and easily accessing single molecule data, a general hidden Markov modeling algorithm for fitting an array of possible models specified by the user, a standardized data structure and graphical user interfaces to streamline the analysis and visualization of data. This approach guides experimental design, facilitating acquisition of the maximal information from single molecule experiments. SMART also provides a standardized format to allow dissemination of single molecule data and transparency in the analysis of reported data.},

By clustering common dynamic behaviors derived from selectively blocked splicing reactions, SiMCAn was able to identify the signature conformations and dynamic behaviors of multiple ATP-dependent intermediates. In addition, it identified an open conformation adopted late in splicing by a 3' splice-site mutant, invoking a mechanism for substrate proofreading. SiMCAn enables rapid interpretation of complex single-molecule behaviors and should prove useful for the comprehensive analysis of a plethora of dynamic cellular machines.},

	abstract = {Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for protein structure determination at high resolution. Here we report the structure of a complex between Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and the cell-permeant inhibitor phenylethyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), determined by cryo-EM at an average resolution of {\textasciitilde}2.2 angstroms (Å). Besides the PETG ligand, we identified densities in the map for {\textasciitilde}800 water molecules and for magnesium and sodium ions. Although it is likely that continued advances in detector technology may further enhance resolution, our findings demonstrate that preparation of specimens of adequate quality and intrinsic protein flexibility, rather than imaging or image-processing technologies, now represent the major bottlenecks to routinely achieving resolutions close to 2 Å using single-particle cryo-EM.
Pushing the limits of electron microscopy
Recent advances in cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allow structures of large macromolecules to be determined at near-atomic resolution. So far, though, resolutions approaching 2 Å, where features key to drug design are revealed, remain the province of x-ray crystallography. Bartesaghi et al. achieved a resolution of 2.2 Å for a 465-kD ligand-bound protein complex using cryo-EM. The density map is detailed enough to show close to 800 water molecules, magnesium and sodium ions, and precise side-chain conformations. These results bring routine use of cryo-EM in rational drug design a step closer.

Using Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that estimation algorithms can come close to attaining the limit given in the expression. Explicit quantitative results are also provided to show how the limit of the localization accuracy is reduced by factors such as pixelation of the detector and noise sources in the detection system.

However, in UHMM, only the calculated FRET trajectory is analyzed. On the basis of the analysis of both synthetic and experimental data, we find that, if the noise in the signal is described with a proper probability distribution, MHMM generally outperforms UHMM.
