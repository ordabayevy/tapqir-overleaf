              proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to
              new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release
              of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally
              accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP
              promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth
              cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides
              a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate
              network growth without restraining it.

              All previous work on the initial step of the targeting reaction,
              when SRP binds to RNCs, used stalled and non-translating RNCs.
              This meant that an important dimension of the co-translational

              relevant SRP concentrations that SRP-RNC association and

              the subunit joining reaction functions as a kinetic checkpoint

               also p. [183][3] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Protein degradation,
               mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), plays a
               critical and complementary role to transcription, splicing, and
               translation in the control of gene expression. Effective
               regulation of the UPS relies on the specificity of substrate
               recognition, which is conferred largely by the upstream
               ubiquitylation process. As a specific example, the
               anaphase-promoting complex (APC) acting on a series of
               substrates promotes waves of ubiquitylation and degradation,
               leading to key transitions in the cell cycle. However, in this
               cascade the proteasome itself also plays a role in the
               specificity of degradation. There have been various efforts to
               characterize this role, leading to a commonly held view that a
               substrate protein must be conjugated with a chain of at least
               four ubiquitins to be recognized by the proteasome. Yet mass
               spectrometry studies show that ubiquitin chains on APC
               substrates (such as cyclin B) contain, on average, only two
               ubiquitins. But these can have complex ubiquitin configurations
               created by the multiplicity of ubiquitylated lysine residues.
               Therefore, the tetraubiquitin chain selection rule may not be
               generally applicable, and the mechanism by which the proteasome
               recognizes substrates is still shrouded in mystery. \#\#\#
               RATIONALE The multiple lysines on a substrate and on ubiquitin
               itself generate a large number of possible ubiquitin
               configurations. To understand the ``ubiquitin code'' that must
               be read by the proteasome and converted into a rate of substrate
               degradation, we examined the kinetics of degradation with
               defined ubiquitin configurations by conjugating preformed
               ubiquitin chains on substrate molecules. Further, to reveal the
               molecular basis through which some ubiquitin configurations
               promote more efficient degradation than others, we investigated
               the degradation process using single-molecule (SM) methods that
               are capable of identifying transient intermediates and measuring
               their kinetic parameters and sensitivity to ubiquitin
               configurations. \#\#\# RESULTS Contrary to the tetraubiquitin
               chain selection rule, we find that for APC substrates with
               multiple ubiquitylated lysine residues, diubiquitin chains are
               more efficient than tetraubiquitin chains in promoting
               degradation, given the same number of conjugated ubiquitins.
               Ubiquitin chains are essential for degradation of most
               substrates. Nevertheless, a multiple monoubiquitylated form of
               securin, a regulator of chromatid separation, interacts with the
               proteasome as strongly as securin containing the same number of
               ubiquitins grouped in chains. By dissecting the degradation
               process using SM methods, we find that ubiquitin chain
               structures on substrates promote the passage of a bound
               substrate into the translocation channel on the proteasome.
               \#\#\# CONCLUSION This systematic study of synthetically
               constructed ubiquitylated substrates with defined configurations
               revealed no simple length threshold for ubiquitin chains for
               degradation by the proteasome. A distributed array of short
               ubiquitin chains, as appears naturally on APC substrates, is a
               superior and perhaps optimal signal for degradation; this
               conclusion will most likely extend to substrates of other E3
               ligases. The rate of degradation is an aggregate of two
               sequential processes: substrate binding and kinetic postbinding
               events. In the past, it was widely assumed that ubiquitin chains
               mostly promoted binding to the proteasome. Our SM studies
               demonstrate that the strength of interaction with the
               proteasome, for substrates with multiple ubiquitylated lysines,
               is largely determined by the total number of ubiquitins and is
               less sensitive to ubiquitin chain configurations. For most
               substrates, binding alone is not sufficient for degradation.
               Rather, degradation depends strongly on a process that initiates
               passage into the substrate translocation channel; this
               transition, in contrast to binding, is determined by the
               particular configuration of ubiquitin chains. ![Figure][4] Key
               transitions in the degradation of ubiquitylated substrates by
               the proteasome. A polyubiquitylated substrate molecule explores
               multiple configurations on the proteasome through stochastic
               binding. Rearrangements of proteasomal subunits, driven by the
               binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, allow a deeper
               engagement of the substrate with the proteasome, when there are
               appropriate ubiquitin chain structures on the substrate. As a
               result of this engagement, the substrate or its terminus is
               moved closer to the substrate entry port, promoting expeditious
               initiation of translocation and ensuing degradation. To address
               how the configuration of conjugated ubiquitins determines the
               recognition of substrates by the proteasome, we analyzed the
               degradation kinetics of substrates with chemically defined
               ubiquitin configurations. Contrary to the view that a
               tetraubiquitin chain is the minimal signal for efficient
               degradation, we find that distributing the ubiquitins as
               diubiquitin chains provides a more efficient signal. To
               understand how the proteasome actually discriminates among
               ubiquitin configurations, we developed single-molecule assays
               that distinguished intermediate steps of degradation
               kinetically. The level of ubiquitin on a substrate drives
               proteasome-substrate interaction, whereas the chain structure of
               ubiquitin affects translocation into the axial channel on the
               proteasome. Together these two features largely determine the
               susceptibility of substrates for proteasomal degradation. [1]:

              we present a new algorithm called SSM\_BIC for such purpose. The
              SSM\_BIC combines the advantages of the Structured Sparse Model
              (SSM) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Through
              simulation and experimental studies, we evaluate systematically
              the performance between the SSM\_BIC and the conventional Sparse
              algorithm in high-density localization of active molecules. We
              show that the SSM\_BIC is superior in processing single molecule
              images with weak signal embedded in strong background.",

              accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for

                   introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only
                   provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a
                   probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the
                   techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is
                   aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level
                   understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic
                   machine learning and programming languages. We start with a
                   discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why
                   conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the
                   fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial
                   intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order
                   probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs
                   define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality
                   models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce
                   fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can
                   be implemented in the context of models denoted by
                   probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document,
                   we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming
                   language, with a functionality analogous to that of
                   established programming languages. This affords the
                   opportunity to define models with dynamic computation
                   graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that
                   generate samples by repeatedly executing the program.
                   Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of
                   probabilistic programming language are explained in the
                   context of an interface between program executions and an
                   inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on
                   advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of
                   writing, interesting directions for probabilistic

              a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage

              where termination is enhanced by TFIISDN, suggesting that
              backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination.
              Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape
              from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long
              transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes.
