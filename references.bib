              between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The
              accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for

                   introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only
                   provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a
                   probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the
                   techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is
                   aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level
                   understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic
                   machine learning and programming languages. We start with a
                   discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why
                   conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the
                   fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial
                   intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order
                   probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs
                   define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality
                   models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce
                   fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can
                   be implemented in the context of models denoted by
                   probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document,
                   we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming
                   language, with a functionality analogous to that of
                   established programming languages. This affords the
                   opportunity to define models with dynamic computation
                   graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that
                   generate samples by repeatedly executing the program.
                   Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of
                   probabilistic programming language are explained in the
                   context of an interface between program executions and an
                   inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on

              a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage

  abstract  = "We describe an implementation of maximum likelihood
               classification for single particle electron cryo-microscopy that
               is based on the FREALIGN software. Particle alignment parameters
               are determined by maximizing a joint likelihood that can include
               hierarchical priors, while classification is performed by
               expectation maximization of a marginal likelihood. We test the
               FREALIGN implementation using a simulated dataset containing
               computer-generated projection images of three different 70S
               ribosome structures, as well as a publicly available dataset of
               70S ribosomes. The results show that the mixed strategy of the
               new FREALIGN algorithm yields performance on par with other
               maximum likelihood implementations, while remaining
               computationally efficient.",
