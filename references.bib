               Spread Function (PSF) model for fitting the position of

               attractiveness the appropriateness of the Gaussian is
               questionable as it is not based on the laws of optics. Here we
               study the effect of emission dipole orientation in conjunction
               with optical aberrations on the localization accuracy of
               position estimators based on a Gaussian model PSF. Simulated
               image spots, calculated with all effects of high numerical
               aperture, interfaces between media, polarization, dipole
               orientation and aberrations taken into account, were fitted with
               a Gaussian PSF based Maximum Likelihood Estimator. For freely
               rotating dipole emitters it is found that the Gaussian works
               fine. The same, theoretically optimum, localization accuracy is
               found as if the true PSF were a Gaussian, even for aberrations
               within the usual tolerance limit of high-end optical imaging
               systems such as microscopes (Marechal's diffraction limit). For
               emitters with a fixed dipole orientation this is not the case.
               Localization errors are found that reach up to 40 nm for typical
               system parameters and aberration levels at the diffraction
               limit. These are systematic errors that are independent of the
               total photon count in the image. The Gaussian function is
               therefore inappropriate, and more sophisticated PSF models are a
               practical necessity.",

  abstract  = "A dual-view imaging system for simultaneous four-color
               single-molecule (SM) detection was developed. As for the
               detection procedure, four species of SM fluorophores, namely,
               Alexa 488, 555, 647, and 680, are immobilized on different
               slides and excited by evanescent-wave illumination. Fluorescence
               emitted from an SM fluorophore is split by a wide-range dichroic
               mirror (WR DM) in a dual-view optics and imaged as two SM
               fluorescence spots (SM spots) on an electron-multiplying
               charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) at 100 Hz. The transmittance of
               the WR DM changes gradually over the wavelength range of 500 to
               700 nm so that the signal ratios of the two SM spots for the
               four fluorophore species differ. A method for classifying SM
               fluorophores into four species in accordance with their signal
               ratios was developed. It was used to classify 597 SM
               fluorophores at an accuracy of above 98\% for all the species.
               This accuracy is comparable to that of a conventional four-color
               SM detection system. To classify four species, the conventional
               system disperses SM fluorescence with a prism and provides an
               elongated SM spot that uses more pixels of an EM-CCD chip than
               that of the developed system. The developed system can thus
               detect 1.5-fold more SM spots with the same-size EM-CCD chip, so
               it can achieve 1.5-fold higher throughput. Moreover, the
               developed system is based on a simple and practical approach,
               namely, replacing an ordinary dichroic mirror in a commercially
               available dual-view optics with a WR DM. This replacement
               transforms a dual-view imaging system for two-color detection
               into a system for four-color detection. The developed system is
               suitable for detection systems of next-generation DNA sequencers

@ARTICLE{Rains2010-ju,
  title    = "A Bayesian method for construction of Markov models to describe
              dynamics on various time-scales",
  author   = "Rains, Emily K and Andersen, Hans C",
  abstract = "The dynamics of many biological processes of interest, such as
              the folding of a protein, are slow and complicated enough that a
              single molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of the entire
              process is difficult to obtain in any reasonable amount of time.
              Moreover, one such simulation may not be sufficient to develop an
              understanding of the mechanism of the process, and multiple
              simulations may be necessary. One approach to circumvent this
              computational barrier is the use of Markov state models. These
              models are useful because they can be constructed using data from
              a large number of shorter simulations instead of a single long
              simulation. This paper presents a new Bayesian method for the
              construction of Markov models from simulation data. A Markov
              model is specified by ($\tau$,P,T), where $\tau$ is the
              mesoscopic time step, P is a partition of configuration space
              into mesostates, and T is an N(P)$\times$N(P) transition rate
              matrix for transitions between the mesostates in one mesoscopic
              time step, where N(P) is the number of mesostates in P. The
              method presented here is different from previous Bayesian methods
              in several ways. (1) The method uses Bayesian analysis to
              determine the partition as well as the transition probabilities.
              (2) The method allows the construction of a Markov model for any
              chosen mesoscopic time-scale $\tau$. (3) It constructs Markov
              models for which the diagonal elements of T are all equal to or
              greater than 0.5. Such a model will be called a ``consistent
              mesoscopic Markov model'' (CMMM). Such models have important
              advantages for providing an understanding of the dynamics on a
              mesoscopic time-scale. The Bayesian method uses simulation data
              to find a posterior probability distribution for (P,T) for any
              chosen $\tau$. This distribution can be regarded as the Bayesian
              probability that the kinetics observed in the atomistic
              simulation data on the mesoscopic time-scale $\tau$ was generated
              by the CMMM specified by (P,T). An optimization algorithm is used
              to find the most probable CMMM for the chosen mesoscopic time
              step. We applied this method of Markov model construction to
              several toy systems (random walks in one and two dimensions) as
              well as the dynamics of alanine dipeptide in water. The resulting
              Markov state models were indeed successful in capturing the
              dynamics of our test systems on a variety of mesoscopic
              time-scales.",

              for the study of cell biological processes. However, all

              to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and
              characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally
              extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished.
              We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules

              at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope
              equipped with an Ar(+)-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera,
              single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were
              detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to
              approximately 10 microm from the interface. A time resolution of
              5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The

              recruitment of these proteins to transcription complexes, and of
              the transitions between these steps, are poorly understood. We
              used multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to
              directly image and quantitate these dynamics in a budding yeast
              nuclear extract that reconstitutes activator-dependent
              transcription in vitro. A strong activator (Gal4-VP16) greatly
              stimulated reversible binding of individual RNApII molecules to
              template DNA. Binding of labeled elongation factor Spt4/5 to DNA
              typically followed RNApII binding, was NTP dependent, and was
              correlated with association of mRNA binding protein Hek2,
              demonstrating specificity of Spt4/5 binding to elongation
              complexes. Quantitative kinetic modeling shows that only a
              fraction of RNApII binding events are productive and implies a
              rate-limiting step, probably associated with recruitment of
              general transcription factors, needed to assemble a
              transcription-competent preinitiation complex at the promoter.
              Spt4/5 association with transcription complexes was slowly
              reversible, with DNA-bound RNApII molecules sometimes binding and
              releasing Spt4/5 multiple times. The average Spt4/5 residence

              an average length yeast gene. These dynamics suggest that a
              single Spt4/5 molecule remains associated during a typical
              transcription event, yet can dissociate from RNApII to allow

              Markov Jump Processes",
  author   = "Kilic, Zeliha and Sgouralis, Ioannis and Press{\'e}, Steve",
  abstract = "The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a framework for time series
              analysis widely applied to single-molecule experiments. Although
              initially developed for applications outside the natural
              sciences, the HMM has traditionally been used to interpret
              signals generated by physical systems, such as single molecules,
              evolving in a discrete state space observed at discrete time
              levels dictated by the data acquisition rate. Within the HMM
              framework, transitions between states are modeled as occurring at
              the end of each data acquisition period and are described using
              transition probabilities. Yet, whereas measurements are often
              performed at discrete time levels in the natural sciences,
              physical systems evolve in continuous time according to
              transition rates. It then follows that the modeling assumptions
              underlying the HMM are justified if the transition rates of a
              physical process from state to state are small as compared to the
              data acquisition rate. In other words, HMMs apply to slow
              kinetics. The problem is, because the transition rates are
              unknown in principle, it is unclear, a priori, whether the HMM
              applies to a particular system. For this reason, we must
              generalize HMMs for physical systems, such as single molecules,
              because these switch between discrete states in ``continuous
              time''. We do so by exploiting recent mathematical tools
              developed in the context of inferring Markov jump processes and
              propose the hidden Markov jump process. We explicitly show in
              what limit the hidden Markov jump process reduces to the HMM.
              Resolving the discrete time discrepancy of the HMM has clear
              implications: we no longer need to assume that processes, such as
              molecular events, must occur on timescales slower than data
              acquisition and can learn transition rates even if these are on
              the same timescale or otherwise exceed data acquisition rates.",

  abstract      = "We address the problem of analyzing sets of noisy
                   time-varying signals that all report on the same process but
                   confound straightforward analyses due to complex
                   inter-signal heterogeneities and measurement artifacts. In
                   particular we consider single-molecule experiments which
                   indirectly measure the distinct steps in a biomolecular
                   process via observations of noisy time-dependent signals
                   such as a fluorescence intensity or bead position.
                   Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt
                   to characterize such processes in terms of a set of
                   conformational states, the transitions that can occur
                   between these states, and the associated rates at which
                   those transitions occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing
                   steps to combine multiple signals. Here we develop a

                   introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only
                   provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a
                   probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the
                   techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is
                   aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level
                   understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic
                   machine learning and programming languages. We start with a
                   discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why
                   conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the
                   fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial
                   intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order
                   probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs
                   define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality
                   models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce
                   fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can
                   be implemented in the context of models denoted by
                   probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document,
                   we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming
                   language, with a functionality analogous to that of
                   established programming languages. This affords the
                   opportunity to define models with dynamic computation
                   graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that
                   generate samples by repeatedly executing the program.
                   Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of
                   probabilistic programming language are explained in the
                   context of an interface between program executions and an
                   inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on
                   advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of
                   writing, interesting directions for probabilistic
                   programming research; directions that point towards a tight
                   integration with deep neural network research and the

              present in a smFRET time trace (a hallmark of nonparametric

              single molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time
              series data requiring equally novel computational tools for
              analysis and inference. This article describes in general terms
              how graphical modeling may be used to learn from biophysical time
              series data using the variational Bayesian expectation
              maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by
              the example of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy
              transfer (smFRET) versus time data, where the smFRET time series
              is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian
              observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as
              well. RESULTS: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence
              and an approximating posterior parameter distribution given the
              data. The former provides a metric for model selection via
              maximum evidence (ME), and the latter a description of the
              model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide several
              advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum
              likelihood (ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM)
              algorithm, the most important being a natural form of model
              selection and a well-posed (non-divergent) optimization problem.

              nucleotide misincorporation. Using multiwavelength
              single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we observed the dynamics
              of GreB interactions with elongation complexes. GreB binds to
              actively elongating complexes at nearly diffusion-limited rates
              but remains bound for only 0.3-0.5 s, longer than the duration of
              the nucleotide addition cycle but far shorter than the time
              needed to synthesize a complete mRNA. Bound GreB inhibits
              transcript elongation only partially. To test whether GreB
              preferentially binds backtracked complexes, we reconstituted
              complexes stabilized in backtracked and nonbacktracked
              configurations. By verifying the functional state of each
              molecular complex studied, we could exclude models in which GreB
              is selectively recruited to backtracked complexes or is ejected
              from RNAP by catalytic turnover. Instead, GreB binds rapidly and
              randomly to elongation complexes, patrolling for those requiring
              nucleolytic rescue, and its short residence time minimizes RNAP
              inhibition. The results suggest a general mechanism by which SC
              factors may cooperate to regulate RNAP while minimizing mutual
              interference.",

              has enabled direct measurements of nanometre displacements and

              elucidate how myosin generates movement, it is necessary to
              understand how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to mechanical work at
              the level of the single molecule. But the most sensitive
              microscopic ATPase assay available still requires over 1,000
              myosins9. To enhance the sensitivity of such assays, we have
              refined epifluorescence and total internal reflection

  abstract = "Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) can be applied to extract single
              channel kinetics at signal-to-noise ratios that are too low for
              conventional analysis. There are two general HMM approaches:
              traditional Baum's reestimation and direct optimization. The
              optimization approach has the advantage that it optimizes the
              rate constants directly. This allows setting constraints on the
              rate constants, fitting multiple data sets across different
              experimental conditions, and handling nonstationary channels
              where the starting probability of the channel depends on the
              unknown kinetics. We present here an extension of this approach
              that addresses the additional issues of low-pass filtering and
              correlated noise. The filtering is modeled using a finite impulse
              response (FIR) filter applied to the underlying signal, and the
              noise correlation is accounted for using an autoregressive (AR)
              process. In addition to correlated background noise, the
              algorithm allows for excess open channel noise that can be white

              derive the analytical derivatives of the likelihood function with
              respect to all unknown model parameters. The search of the
              likelihood space is performed using a variable metric method.

              All previous work on the initial step of the targeting reaction,

              This meant that an important dimension of the co-translational

              colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS)

              directly compared the rates of initial polymerase binding to and
              dissociation from promoter and nonpromoter DNAs measured in the
              same sample under identical conditions. Binding to a nonpromoter
              DNA was much slower than binding to a promoter-containing DNA of
              the same length, indicating that the detected nonspecific binding
              events are not on the pathway to promoter binding. Truncating one
              of the DNA segments flanking the promoter to a length as short as
              7 bp or lengthening it to ~3,000 bp did not alter the
              promoter-specific binding rate. These results exclude FD over
              distances corresponding to the length of the promoter or longer
              from playing any significant role in accelerating promoter
              search. Instead, the data support a direct binding mechanism, in
              which $\sigma$(54)RNA polymerase reaches the local vicinity of
              promoters by 3D diffusion through solution, and suggest that
              binding may be accelerated by atypical structural or dynamic

              can quickly reach a promoter, despite occupancy of
              promoter-flanking DNA by bound proteins that would impede FD.",

               also p. [183][3] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Protein degradation,
               mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), plays a
               critical and complementary role to transcription, splicing, and
               translation in the control of gene expression. Effective
               regulation of the UPS relies on the specificity of substrate
               recognition, which is conferred largely by the upstream
               ubiquitylation process. As a specific example, the
               anaphase-promoting complex (APC) acting on a series of
               substrates promotes waves of ubiquitylation and degradation,
               leading to key transitions in the cell cycle. However, in this
               cascade the proteasome itself also plays a role in the
               specificity of degradation. There have been various efforts to
               characterize this role, leading to a commonly held view that a
               substrate protein must be conjugated with a chain of at least
               four ubiquitins to be recognized by the proteasome. Yet mass
               spectrometry studies show that ubiquitin chains on APC
               substrates (such as cyclin B) contain, on average, only two
               ubiquitins. But these can have complex ubiquitin configurations
               created by the multiplicity of ubiquitylated lysine residues.
               Therefore, the tetraubiquitin chain selection rule may not be
               generally applicable, and the mechanism by which the proteasome
               recognizes substrates is still shrouded in mystery. \#\#\#
               RATIONALE The multiple lysines on a substrate and on ubiquitin
               itself generate a large number of possible ubiquitin
               configurations. To understand the ``ubiquitin code'' that must
               be read by the proteasome and converted into a rate of substrate
               degradation, we examined the kinetics of degradation with
               defined ubiquitin configurations by conjugating preformed
               ubiquitin chains on substrate molecules. Further, to reveal the
               molecular basis through which some ubiquitin configurations
               promote more efficient degradation than others, we investigated
               the degradation process using single-molecule (SM) methods that
               are capable of identifying transient intermediates and measuring
               their kinetic parameters and sensitivity to ubiquitin
               configurations. \#\#\# RESULTS Contrary to the tetraubiquitin
               chain selection rule, we find that for APC substrates with
               multiple ubiquitylated lysine residues, diubiquitin chains are
               more efficient than tetraubiquitin chains in promoting
               degradation, given the same number of conjugated ubiquitins.
               Ubiquitin chains are essential for degradation of most
               substrates. Nevertheless, a multiple monoubiquitylated form of
               securin, a regulator of chromatid separation, interacts with the
               proteasome as strongly as securin containing the same number of
               ubiquitins grouped in chains. By dissecting the degradation
               process using SM methods, we find that ubiquitin chain
               structures on substrates promote the passage of a bound
               substrate into the translocation channel on the proteasome.
               \#\#\# CONCLUSION This systematic study of synthetically
               constructed ubiquitylated substrates with defined configurations
               revealed no simple length threshold for ubiquitin chains for
               degradation by the proteasome. A distributed array of short
               ubiquitin chains, as appears naturally on APC substrates, is a
               superior and perhaps optimal signal for degradation; this
               conclusion will most likely extend to substrates of other E3
               ligases. The rate of degradation is an aggregate of two
               sequential processes: substrate binding and kinetic postbinding
               events. In the past, it was widely assumed that ubiquitin chains
               mostly promoted binding to the proteasome. Our SM studies
               demonstrate that the strength of interaction with the
               proteasome, for substrates with multiple ubiquitylated lysines,
               is largely determined by the total number of ubiquitins and is
               less sensitive to ubiquitin chain configurations. For most
               substrates, binding alone is not sufficient for degradation.
               Rather, degradation depends strongly on a process that initiates
               passage into the substrate translocation channel; this
               transition, in contrast to binding, is determined by the
               particular configuration of ubiquitin chains. ![Figure][4] Key
               transitions in the degradation of ubiquitylated substrates by
               the proteasome. A polyubiquitylated substrate molecule explores
               multiple configurations on the proteasome through stochastic
               binding. Rearrangements of proteasomal subunits, driven by the
               binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, allow a deeper
               engagement of the substrate with the proteasome, when there are
               appropriate ubiquitin chain structures on the substrate. As a
               result of this engagement, the substrate or its terminus is
               moved closer to the substrate entry port, promoting expeditious
               initiation of translocation and ensuing degradation. To address
               how the configuration of conjugated ubiquitins determines the
               recognition of substrates by the proteasome, we analyzed the
               degradation kinetics of substrates with chemically defined
               ubiquitin configurations. Contrary to the view that a
               tetraubiquitin chain is the minimal signal for efficient
               degradation, we find that distributing the ubiquitins as
               diubiquitin chains provides a more efficient signal. To
               understand how the proteasome actually discriminates among
               ubiquitin configurations, we developed single-molecule assays
               that distinguished intermediate steps of degradation
               kinetically. The level of ubiquitin on a substrate drives
               proteasome-substrate interaction, whereas the chain structure of
               ubiquitin affects translocation into the axial channel on the
               proteasome. Together these two features largely determine the
               susceptibility of substrates for proteasomal degradation. [1]:

                   objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using
                   the same approach for higher-order derivatives is more
                   challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing
                   such estimators is laborious and not compliant with
                   automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL
                   to construct new objectives for each order derivative
                   involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations.
                   Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under

              has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which
              rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS
              affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly
              understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using
              a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage
              and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most
              frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow
              elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions
              where termination is enhanced by TFIISDN, suggesting that
              backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination.
              Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape
              from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long
              transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes.
              TFIISDN slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting
              that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of

              heterohexameric Mcm2-7 complexes into a head-to-head double
              hexamer that facilitates bidirectional replication initiation.
              Using multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence to monitor
              the events of helicase loading, we demonstrate that
              double-hexamer formation is the result of sequential loading of
              individual Mcm2-7 complexes. Loading of each Mcm2-7 molecule
              involves the ordered association and dissociation of distinct
              Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins. In contrast, one ORC molecule directs
              loading of both helicases in each double hexamer. Based on
              single-molecule FRET, arrival of the second Mcm2-7 results in
              rapid double-hexamer formation that anticipates Cdc6 and Cdt1

  abstract = "Production of a messenger RNA proceeds through sequential stages
              of transcription initiation and transcript elongation and
              termination. During each of these stages, RNA polymerase (RNAP)
              function is regulated by RNAP-associated protein factors. In
              bacteria, RNAP-associated $\sigma$ factors are strictly required
              for promoter recognition and have historically been regarded as
              dedicated initiation factors. However, the primary $\sigma$
              factor in Escherichia coli, $\sigma$(70), can remain associated
              with RNAP during the transition from initiation to elongation,
              influencing events that occur after initiation. Quantitative
              studies on the extent of $\sigma$(70) retention have been limited
              to complexes halted during early elongation. Here, we used
              multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence-colocalization
              microscopy to observe the $\sigma$(70)-RNAP complex during
              initiation from the $\lambda$ PR' promoter and throughout the
              elongation of a long (>2,000-nt) transcript. Our results provide
              direct measurements of the fraction of actively transcribing
              complexes with bound $\sigma$(70) and the kinetics of
              $\sigma$(70) release from actively transcribing complexes.
              $\sigma$(70) release from mature elongation complexes was slow
              (0.0038 s(-1)); a substantial subpopulation of elongation
              complexes retained $\sigma$(70) throughout transcript elongation,
              and this fraction depended on the sequence of the initially
              transcribed region. We also show that elongation complexes
              containing $\sigma$(70) manifest enhanced recognition of a
              promoter-like pause element positioned hundreds of nucleotides
              downstream of the promoter. Together, the results provide a
              quantitative framework for understanding the postinitiation roles
              of $\sigma$(70) during transcription.",
