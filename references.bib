  abstract = "Single molecule microscopy is a relatively new optical microscopy
              technique that allows the detection of individual molecules such
              as proteins in a cellular context. This technique has generated
              significant interest among biologists, biophysicists and
              biochemists, as it holds the promise to provide novel insights
              into subcellular processes and structures that otherwise cannot
              be gained through traditional experimental approaches. Single
              molecule experiments place stringent demands on experimental and
              algorithmic tools due to the low signal levels and the presence
              of significant extraneous noise sources. Consequently, this has
              necessitated the use of advanced statistical signal and image
              processing techniques for the design and analysis of single
              molecule experiments. In this tutorial paper, we provide an
              overview of single molecule microscopy from early works to
              current applications and challenges. Specific emphasis will be on
              the quantitative aspects of this imaging modality, in particular
              single molecule localization and resolvability, which will be
              discussed from an information theoretic perspective. We review
              the stochastic framework for image formation, different types of
              estimation techniques and expressions for the Fisher information
              matrix. We also discuss several open problems in the field that
              demand highly non-trivial signal processing algorithms.",

  abstract      = "We propose a notation for tensors with named axes, which
                   relieves the author, reader, and future implementers from
                   the burden of keeping track of the order of axes and the
                   purpose of each. It also makes it easy to extend operations
                   on low-order tensors to higher order ones (e.g., to extend
                   an operation on images to minibatches of images, or extend
                   the attention mechanism to multiple attention heads). After
                   a brief overview of our notation, we illustrate it through
                   several examples from modern machine learning, from building
                   blocks like attention and convolution to full models like
                   Transformers and LeNet. Finally, we give formal definitions
                   and describe some extensions. Our proposals build on ideas
                   from many previous papers and software libraries. We hope
                   that this document will encourage more authors to use named
                   tensors, resulting in clearer papers and less bug-prone

                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order

                   computationally efficient, has little memory requirements,
                   is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is
                   well suited for problems that are large in terms of data
                   and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for
                   non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy
                   and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some
                   connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was

                   well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic

               Spread Function (PSF) model for fitting the position of

               attractiveness the appropriateness of the gaussian is
               questionable as it is not based on the laws of optics. Here we
               study the effect of emission dipole orientation in conjunction
               with optical aberrations on the localization accuracy of
               position estimators based on a gaussian model PSF. Simulated
               image spots, calculated with all effects of high numerical
               aperture, interfaces between media, polarization, dipole
               orientation and aberrations taken into account, were fitted with
               a gaussian PSF based Maximum Likelihood Estimator. For freely
               rotating dipole emitters it is found that the gaussian works
               fine. The same, theoretically optimum, localization accuracy is
               found as if the true PSF were a gaussian, even for aberrations
               within the usual tolerance limit of high-end optical imaging
               systems such as microscopes (Marechal's diffraction limit). For
               emitters with a fixed dipole orientation this is not the case.
               Localization errors are found that reach up to 40 nm for typical
               system parameters and aberration levels at the diffraction
               limit. These are systematic errors that are independent of the
               total photon count in the image. The gaussian function is
               therefore inappropriate, and more sophisticated PSF models are a
               practical necessity.",

  abstract  = "A dual-view imaging system for simultaneous four-color
               single-molecule (SM) detection was developed. As for the
               detection procedure, four species of SM fluorophores, namely,
               Alexa 488, 555, 647, and 680, are immobilized on different
               slides and excited by evanescent-wave illumination. Fluorescence
               emitted from an SM fluorophore is split by a wide-range dichroic
               mirror (WR DM) in a dual-view optics and imaged as two SM
               fluorescence spots (SM spots) on an electron-multiplying
               charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) at 100 Hz. The transmittance of
               the WR DM changes gradually over the wavelength range of 500 to
               700 nm so that the signal ratios of the two SM spots for the
               four fluorophore species differ. A method for classifying SM
               fluorophores into four species in accordance with their signal
               ratios was developed. It was used to classify 597 SM
               fluorophores at an accuracy of above 98\% for all the species.
               This accuracy is comparable to that of a conventional four-color
               SM detection system. To classify four species, the conventional
               system disperses SM fluorescence with a prism and provides an
               elongated SM spot that uses more pixels of an EM-CCD chip than
               that of the developed system. The developed system can thus
               detect 1.5-fold more SM spots with the same-size EM-CCD chip, so
               it can achieve 1.5-fold higher throughput. Moreover, the
               developed system is based on a simple and practical approach,
               namely, replacing an ordinary dichroic mirror in a commercially
               available dual-view optics with a WR DM. This replacement
               transforms a dual-view imaging system for two-color detection
               into a system for four-color detection. The developed system is
               suitable for detection systems of next-generation DNA sequencers

              recent development in optical microscopy holding great promise
              for the study of cell biological processes. However, all
              experimental strategies realized so far confined the observation
              to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and
              characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally
              extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished.
              We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules

              at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope
              equipped with an Ar(+)-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera,
              single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were
              detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to
              approximately 10 microm from the interface. A time resolution of
              5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The
              two-dimensional localization accuracy was determined to be
              approximately 30 nm. The number of photons emitted by single GFP

              the trajectories, the diffusion coefficients of single GFP

  abstract = "In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II (RNApII) transcribes messenger
              RNA from template DNA. Decades of experiments have identified the
              proteins needed for transcription activation, initiation complex
              assembly, and productive elongation. However, the dynamics of
              recruitment of these proteins to transcription complexes, and of
              the transitions between these steps, are poorly understood. We
              used multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to
              directly image and quantitate these dynamics in a budding yeast
              nuclear extract that reconstitutes activator-dependent
              transcription in vitro. A strong activator (Gal4-VP16) greatly
              stimulated reversible binding of individual RNApII molecules to
              template DNA. Binding of labeled elongation factor Spt4/5 to DNA
              typically followed RNApII binding, was NTP dependent, and was
              correlated with association of mRNA binding protein Hek2,
              demonstrating specificity of Spt4/5 binding to elongation
              complexes. Quantitative kinetic modeling shows that only a
              fraction of RNApII binding events are productive and implies a
              rate-limiting step, probably associated with recruitment of
              general transcription factors, needed to assemble a
              transcription-competent preinitiation complex at the promoter.
              Spt4/5 association with transcription complexes was slowly
              reversible, with DNA-bound RNApII molecules sometimes binding and
              releasing Spt4/5 multiple times. The average Spt4/5 residence
              time was of similar magnitude to the time required to transcribe

                   introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only
                   provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a
                   probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the
                   techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is
                   aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level
                   understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic
                   machine learning and programming languages. We start with a
                   discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why
                   conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the
                   fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial
                   intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order
                   probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs
                   define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality
                   models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce
                   fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can
                   be implemented in the context of models denoted by
                   probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document,
                   we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming
                   language, with a functionality analogous to that of
                   established programming languages. This affords the
                   opportunity to define models with dynamic computation
                   graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that
                   generate samples by repeatedly executing the program.
                   Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of
                   probabilistic programming language are explained in the
                   context of an interface between program executions and an
                   inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on
                   advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of
                   writing, interesting directions for probabilistic
                   programming research; directions that point towards a tight
                   integration with deep neural network research and the

              Markov analysis, which already treats photon shot noise, in three
              critical ways: (1) it learns the number of molecular states
              present in a smFRET time trace (a hallmark of nonparametric

               fluorophore as a continuous fixed-amplitude dipole acting as a
               simple radiator. However, for effect modeling steady-state
               excitation, a fixed-power dipole is more appropriate. This
               modification corresponds to normalizing fixed-amplitude dipole
               intensities by the total dissipated power, which is itself
               dependent on fluorophore orientation and proximity to the
               surface. The results for the fixed-power model differ
               nontrivially from the fixed-amplitude model. Using the
               fixed-power dipole model, we calculate the
               observation-angle-dependent intensity as a function of the
               fluorophore's orientation and distance from the surface. The
               surface can have an intermediate layer of arbitrary thickness on

              filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are
              tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament
              growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we
              revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with
              mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with
              initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP
              proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to
              new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release
              of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally
              accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP
              promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth
              cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides
              a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate
              network growth without restraining it.

              All previous work on the initial step of the targeting reaction,
              when SRP binds to RNCs, used stalled and non-translating RNCs.
              This meant that an important dimension of the co-translational
              process remained unstudied. We apply single-molecule fluorescence
              measurements to observe directly and in real-time E. coli SRP
              binding to actively translating RNCs. We show at physiologically
              relevant SRP concentrations that SRP-RNC association and
              dissociation rates depend on nascent chain length and the
              exposure of a functional signal sequence outside the ribosome.
              Our results resolve a long-standing question: how can a limited,
              sub-stoichiometric pool of cellular SRP effectively distinguish
              RNCs displaying a signal sequence from those that are not? The

              various proteins within the replisome have been determined.
              Although many of their interactions have been characterized, it

              translation initiation is catalyzed by the initiation factor (IF)
              IF2. Because the rate of subunit joining is coupled to the IF,
              transfer RNA (tRNA), and mRNA codon compositions of the 30S IC,
              the subunit joining reaction functions as a kinetic checkpoint
              that regulates the fidelity of translation initiation. Recent
              structural studies suggest that the conformational dynamics of
              the IF2·tRNA sub-complex forming on the intersubunit surface of
              the 30S IC may play a significant role in the mechanisms that
              couple the rate of subunit joining to the IF, tRNA, and codon
              compositions of the 30S IC. To test this hypothesis, we have
              developed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy

              monitor the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex

              joining exhibit a decreased affinity for IF2 and/or a change in
              the conformational dynamics of the IF2·tRNA sub-complex. These
              results strongly suggest that 30S IC-driven changes in the

              of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is
              no better than would be expected for a random selection of
              residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are
              much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase
              (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of
              prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although
              empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein
              structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited
              sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting
              that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will
              not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more
              data from additional protein structure determinations.",

                   estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL)
                   objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using
                   the same approach for higher-order derivatives is more
                   challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing
                   such estimators is laborious and not compliant with
                   automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL
                   to construct new objectives for each order derivative
                   involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations.
                   Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under
                   differentiation, SL treats part of the cost as a fixed
                   sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms for

  abstract = "Production of a messenger RNA proceeds through sequential stages
              of transcription initiation and transcript elongation and
              termination. During each of these stages, RNA polymerase (RNAP)
              function is regulated by RNAP-associated protein factors. In
              bacteria, RNAP-associated $\sigma$ factors are strictly required
              for promoter recognition and have historically been regarded as
              dedicated initiation factors. However, the primary $\sigma$
              factor in Escherichia coli, $\sigma$(70), can remain associated
              with RNAP during the transition from initiation to elongation,
              influencing events that occur after initiation. Quantitative
              studies on the extent of $\sigma$(70) retention have been limited
              to complexes halted during early elongation. Here, we used
              multiwavelength single-molecule fluorescence-colocalization
              microscopy to observe the $\sigma$(70)-RNAP complex during
              initiation from the $\lambda$ PR' promoter and throughout the
              elongation of a long (>2,000-nt) transcript. Our results provide
              direct measurements of the fraction of actively transcribing
              complexes with bound $\sigma$(70) and the kinetics of
              $\sigma$(70) release from actively transcribing complexes.
              $\sigma$(70) release from mature elongation complexes was slow
              (0.0038 s(-1)); a substantial subpopulation of elongation
              complexes retained $\sigma$(70) throughout transcript elongation,
              and this fraction depended on the sequence of the initially
              transcribed region. We also show that elongation complexes
              containing $\sigma$(70) manifest enhanced recognition of a
              promoter-like pause element positioned hundreds of nucleotides
              downstream of the promoter. Together, the results provide a
              quantitative framework for understanding the postinitiation roles
              of $\sigma$(70) during transcription.",
